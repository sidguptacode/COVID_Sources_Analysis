abstract = {Abstract Canada's unemployment rate increased rapidly in the spring of 2020 in response to strict public health measures. Low-wage workers were hit particularly hard, including restaurant workers. The production and distribution of food being essential and agri-food supply chains being resilient, other workers in the agri-food sector were less impacted by public health measures and the pandemic. Employment in grocery stores remained steady and employment of agricultural workers, including temporary foreign workers, proved more robust than expected. Dealing with contaminated workers proved challenging in meat processing plants. Temporary plant shutdowns and slowdowns created livestock queuing problems and temporary increases in meat prices. The federal and provincial governments implemented several programs to mitigate the pandemic's adverse effects on labor markets. The pandemic will have permanent effect on labor markets, but with unemployment rates falling rapidly across Canada, recruiting and retention remain the main labor issues in agriculture.},

abstract = {Abstract This study aimed to explore the perspectives of homelessness service providers on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on service provision, barriers encountered and learning for the future. Semi-structured online interviews were conducted with homelessness service providers (n = 15) identified through the network of homelessness services operating within the United Kingdom. Data were transcribed verbatim and analysed thematically using framework technique. Six key themes were identified including the impact of the pandemic on health and well-being of persons experiencing homelessness (PEH); the changing needs of service users during the pandemic; impact of emergency provision of housing support on services offered; service adaptations; sustainability of services and learnings from the pandemic. Participants described that being able to offer accommodation through government schemes provided protection to PEH through ‘wrap-around support’. The pandemic was deemed to have precipitated change and developed resilience in some services. However, lack of resources, donations and sponsors during the pandemic constrained the services forcing many to close or offer reduced services. Reduced face-to-face contact with PEH and lack of ability to offer skills sessions led to the exacerbation of mental health concerns amongst clients. The pandemic was also identified to have encouraged positive relationship building between clients and service providers, better communications between service providers and effective housing of PEH. There is a need to address the barriers, sustain the positive learnings and enable organisations and PEH to adapt to the transition when transient and emergency support from the government and local councils ends.}

Optimal lockdown and exit strategies are determined based on nonlinear model predictive control, constrained to public-health and socio-economic factors. Through an extensive computational validation of the methodology, it is shown that it is possible to compute robust exit strategies with realistic reduced mobility values to inform public policy making, and we exemplify the applicability of the methodology using datasets from England and France.},

abstract={Social distancing and isolation have been widely introduced to counter the COVID-19 pandemic. Adverse social, psychological and economic consequences of a complete or near-complete lockdown demand the development of more moderate contact-reduction policies. Adopting a social network approach, we evaluate the effectiveness of three distancing strategies designed to keep the curve flat and aid compliance in a post-lockdown world. These are: limiting interaction to a few repeated contacts akin to forming social bubbles; seeking similarity across contacts; and strengthening communities via triadic strategies. We simulate stochastic infection curves incorporating core elements from infection models, ideal-type social network models and statistical relational event models. We demonstrate that a strategic social network-based reduction of contact strongly enhances the effectiveness of social distancing measures while keeping risks lower. We provide scientific evidence for effective social distancing that can be applied in public health messaging and that can mitigate negative consequences of social isolation.},

abstract={BACKGROUND: Health care worker (HCW) safety is of pivotal importance during a pandemic such as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and employee health and well-being ensure functionality of health care institutions. This is particularly true for an intensive care unit (ICU), where highly specialized staff cannot be readily replaced. In the light of lacking evidence for optimal staffing models in a pandemic, we hypothesized that staff shortage can be reduced when staff scheduling takes the epidemiology of a disease into account. METHODS: Various staffing models were constructed, and comprehensive statistical modeling was performed. A typical routine staffing model was defined that assumed full-time employment (40 h/wk) in a 40-bed ICU with a 2:1 patient-to-staff ratio. A pandemic model assumed that staff worked 12-hour shifts for 7 days every other week. Potential in-hospital staff infections were simulated for a total period of 120 days, with a probability of 10{\%}, 25{\%}, and 40{\%} being infected per week when at work. Simulations included the probability of infection at work for a given week, of fatality after infection, and the quarantine time, if infected. RESULTS: Pandemic-adjusted staffing significantly reduced workforce shortage, and the effect progressively increased as the probability of infection increased. Maximum effects were observed at week 4 for each infection probability with a 17{\%}, 32{\%}, and 38{\%} staffing reduction for an infection probability of 0.10, 0.25, and 0.40, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Staffing along epidemiologic considerations may reduce HCW shortage by leveling the nadir of affected workforce. Although this requires considerable efforts and commitment of staff, it may be essential in an effort to best maintain staff health and operational functionality of health care facilities and systems.},

In this article, the authors describe the techniques used in two studies incorporating “thinking aloud” to successfully examine the decision making of expert critical care practitioners in the natural setting. Both techniques of thinking aloud were found to provide useful information regarding decision making in the natural setting. No ethical implications were experienced in conducting these studies in the natural setting. In conclusion, the use of thinking aloud in the natural setting is an effective means of data collection. }

abstract = {Objective To measure public trust in a health information sharing in a broadly defined health system (system trust), inclusive of health care, public health, and research; to identify individual characteristics that predict system trust; and to consider these findings in the context of national health initiatives (e.g., learning health systems and precision medicine) that will expand the scope of data sharing. Data Sources Survey data (n = 1,011) were collected in February 2014. Study Design We constructed a composite index of four dimensions of system trust—competency, fidelity, integrity, and trustworthiness. The index was used in linear regression evaluating demographic and psychosocial predictors of system trust. Data Collection Data were collected by GfK Custom using a nationally representative sample and analyzed in Stata 13.0. Principal Findings Our findings suggest the public's trust may not meet the needs of health systems as they enter an era of expanded data sharing. We found that a majority of the U.S. public does not trust the organizations that have health information and share it (i.e., the health system) in one or more dimensions. Together, demographic and psychosocial factors accounted for ~18 percent of the observed variability in system trust. Future research should consider additional predictors of system trust such as knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs to inform policies and practices for health data sharing.},
